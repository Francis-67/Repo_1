This was a sucessful attempt to get the Echelon USB U10 to be able to communicate in a Linux enviorment. 
Here you will find a very rough installation of the required libs and configs to get the adapter to communicate with the Linux OS. Using a version of Linux called MATE 16 this process was launched.
Once the USB has been recognized Node Utility can be launced and through this you can communicate.
Neuron C is the language associated with the Echelon device. We were talking to the 3150 and 3120 chip sets.
This  project was the launch pad to eventually using the U60 and creating a module that was inserted into the kernel (insmod) to talk on the Lon Network.
